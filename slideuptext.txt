How to Create Hover Effects: Slide-Up Text on an Image

To begin crafting the HTML structure, initiate a new HTML document and establish a dedicated section within it, intended for both the 
appearance and content of the webpage. Next, dive into CSS styling, employing various properties to define the visual aspects. 
This includes setting background images for the entire page and specific elements, determining dimensions, borders, and other visual 
attributes for the primary box and the sliding content box. Proceed to create the main container, serving as the holder for the content 
box where the text will ultimately be displayed. Within this container, construct the content box itself. Populate it with text elements, 
incorporating a headline that emphasizes the phrase "Slide up," along with supplementary text to convey a message or description. 
Implement a hover effect for the main box, triggering the desired sliding movement of the content box upon interaction. Conclude by 
summarizing the steps involved in achieving the slide-up text effect, encouraging further experimentation with HTML and CSS to explore 
a range of effects. Close the tutorial by suggesting the finalization of the HTML document and prompting readers to observe the completed 
result, witnessing the slide-up text effect in action.
